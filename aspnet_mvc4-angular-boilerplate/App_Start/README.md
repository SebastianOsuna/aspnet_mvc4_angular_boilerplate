App_Start

Here lies the configuration files. Each file is used to configure some part of the application.

- `AuthConfig.cs`: **TODO**
- `BundleConfig.cs`: The asset bundles are defined here. Each defined bundle defines a group of assets (Scripts, Styles, etc.). On production, these bundles get minified and concatenated.
- `RouteConfig.cs`: Application HTTP routes are defined in this file. Only one route is defined in this project since we only want to server the SPA's `index.html`.
- `FilterConfig.cs`: **TODO**
- `WebApiConfig.cs`: **TODO**
