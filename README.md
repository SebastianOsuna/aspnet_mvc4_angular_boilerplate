ASP.NET MVC4 - Angular.js Boilerplate
===

This project is a boilerplate codebase for ASP.NET MVC4 projects using Angular as front-end framework.

This boilerplate is intended for SPAs so the ASP code has two sides; Web and an API. The Web part only serves the `index.html` and the assets of the SPA. The API is where the back-end lives.
